# 📈 Polynomial Curve Fitting

This project demonstrates **polynomial regression** for curve fitting using Python.  
We explore polynomial models of different degrees (1, 2, and 3), analyze **residuals**, and compare results with a **robust regression fit** that reduces the effect of outliers.

## 🚀 Project Overview
Curve fitting is a fundamental task in data analysis and machine learning.  
In this project we:
- Fit polynomial models of **degree 1, 2, and 3** to synthetic or real data  
- Visualize the fitted curves against the data  
- Compute and plot **residuals** (errors) to analyze model accuracy  
- Perform a **robust regression fit** to handle outliers effectively
